# TODO-LIST-APP

## Problem Statement:
Create a To-do list application to React Native that does login with Google Auth. The application should have three screens: 
1. Login Screen
2. Task View Screen 
3. Add Task Screen
The ability to log-out should be provided from a side drawer on the Task View screen. The tasks should be stored in a persisted reducer (use Redux and Redux-persist). Please use react-native-paper as your design system. 

It uses React Native v0.66
